    <h2> Implementation </h2>
    <div>

        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p>
        I use gradient domain processing to seamlessly clone a source image into a target image. 
        Whereas a naive blend results in harsh edges, poisson blending creates smooth edges by enforcing gradient consistency.

        <h3> Toy Reconstruction </h3>
        <p>
          
          <hr>

        For the toy reconstruction, I constrain:
         
        1) x gradients  (h*w equations)
        2) y gradients  (h*w equations)
        3) intensities of top left corner pixel (1 equation)

        I construct a coefficient matrix A. Thus, if there are h*w pixels,
        there are 2*(h*w) + 1 total rows in A. 

        Then, I traverse through each pixel in the original image,
        calculating its x, y gradients with the adjacent pixel, and 
        make sure v(x+1, y) - v(x, y) = s(x+1, y) - s(x, y) [and vice
        versa for the y direction] etc... for my new vector v. 
        Finally, I constrain v(0,0) = s(0,0), and reshape v to be shape (h * w).

        <h3> Solving Least Squares for Blending </h3>
        <p>
          <hr>

        For Poisson blending, we solve the blending constraints in a least squares manner,
        solving for vector v of dimensions (hw * 1) that satisfies Av = b.

        A is a coefficient matrix of size (e * hw), where e is the number of equations/constraints. 
        b is a known vector of size (e * 1). 
        
        Our goal is to create an image v which enforces gradient consistencies. 
        For each pixel i = (y,x) in our cropped source region (which we denote S), we define its four 
        neighbors j = (y,x-1), (y,x+1), (y+1,x), (y-1,x). If j is in S, we enforce the 
        consistency of gradient v with the source image. If j is not in S, then we require
        that vi matches the target.

        These computations are performed three times, once per channel (R, G, B).

        <hr>
        For computational efficiency, I use a sparse matrix A and call 
        scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr(A, b) to obtain my solution v. If the input images
        were too large, I had to decrease the "ratio" parameter in main.py 
        to scale down the images. 
        </p>

        <h3> Mixed Blending </h3>
        <p>

            
        I also add a mixed blending method which uses the larger magnitude gradient
        (between the source and target) as guidance.

    The below output does not look quite natural. Despite smoothed edges due to
    Poisson blending, there is still a visible seam which may be due to initial jagged
    cropping when creating the mask. Also, the initial mask cropping included backgrounds
    with multiple colors. Thus, increasing the intensity and widening the spread of 
    blending would be beneficial.
